NMAP is by far one of the best tools for mapping a network, discovering services, and testing for vulnerabilities. That I am not going to discuss with anyone.

But as a programmer, no one can argue with me the pleasure of being able to create your own tool. You better understand many processes, the way things work, and you have control over parts that you can adapt to your needs.

So, while still being able to use NMAP, I have created a simple program to scan ports in an IP range. It is not perfect, but it is functional, and it is also multithreaded, being able to do a network scan with quite acceptable response times.

Any suggestion or contribution is welcome.
